# app_organizacao
This is a app that I've done along with the course.
I'll practice some concepts and design along with coding and exercising the ES6 codes and methods.

#### Day 1
- I did download the start webpage (index.html);
- Basic coding just to recover the values to create a JSON file to include on a localStorage.

//This was something that I needed my project today. Glad that I learned sonner than later.
