# app_organizacao
This is a app that I've done along with the course.
I'll practice some concepts and design along with coding and exercising the ES6 codes and methods.

#### Day 1
- I did download the start webpage (index.html);
- Basic coding just to recover the values to create a JSON file to include on a localStorage.

//This was something that I needed my project today. Glad that I learned sonner than later.

### Day 2
- Refactoring the modal. This way the JS insert the text and classes on modal after each register.
- Now the 'consulta.html' lists all the bd.
- Minor fix when adding new item on the bd. Now it cleans itself after inserting new item.
